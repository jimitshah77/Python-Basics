## Basic Codes:

### 1)print()
```python
print("Basic Coding: Python Programming Language")
```
#### Output:
![python](/images/print.PNG)

### 2)Comments
```python
# We use "#" for single line comment

'''
We can write multiline comment using three qoutes(')
The code within the comment must not be executed
print("For example, this line of code will not be executed")
'''

print("And this line of code will be executed")

```
#### Output:

### 3)Assignment Operator
```python
# We use "=" for assignment of one value to the variable
a= 10
print("The value of a is "+str(a))
# NOTE: We have to convert int to string for maintaining same type in print statement


# We can also assign multiple variable at a time
b,c=20,30
print("The value of b & c is "+str(b)+"&"+str(c))

#We can also assign value of one variable to another variable
d=a
print("The value of d is "+str(d))
```
#### Output:
