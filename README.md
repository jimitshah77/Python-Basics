### 2)Assignment Operator
```python
# We use "=" for assignment of one value to the variable
a= 10
print("The value of a is "+str(a))
# NOTE: We have to convert int to string for maintaining same type in print statement


# We can also assign multiple variable at a time
b,c=20,30
print("The value of b & c is "+str(b)+"&"+str(c))

#We can also assign value of one variable to another variable
d=a
print("The value of d is "+str(d))
```
